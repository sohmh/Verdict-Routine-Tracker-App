# Verdict-Routine-Tracker-App
A self-quantification tool that tracks daily task completion across custom routines and scores performance on a 0–10 scale using a dynamic exponential formula  where the penalty for incomplete tasks grows proportionally to how many were skipped. Aggregates into weekly, monthly, and yearly performance scores, each mapped to a qualitative verdict .
